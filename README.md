# CC Quest

Make CCs the Requesters of Zendesk tickets 

### The App looks at the ticket information and:

* Displays the current Ticket Requester.
* Creates an alphabetical list of all the CCs in the ticket.
* Let's you choose one CC to make the new Ticket Requester.
* Gives you the option of adding the old Ticket Requester to the list of CCs.

Please submit bug reports [here](https://github.com/aculligan/CC_Quest/issues). Pull requests are welcome.
